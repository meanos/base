# LP: #1446748 - limit this to AF_INET/AF_INET6
socket

# This is an older interface and single entry point that can be used instead
# of socket(), bind(), connect(), etc individually. While we could allow it,
# we wouldn't be able to properly arg filter socketcall for AF_INET/AF_INET6
# when LP: #1446748 is implemented.
