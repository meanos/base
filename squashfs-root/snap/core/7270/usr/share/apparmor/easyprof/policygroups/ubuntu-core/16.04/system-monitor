ptrace (read),

# ptrace can be used to break out of the seccomp sandbox, but ps requests
# 'ptrace (trace)' even though it isn't tracing other processes. Unfortunately,
# this is due to the kernel overloading trace such that the LSMs are unable to
# distinguish between tracing other processes and other accesses. We deny the
# trace here to silence the log.
