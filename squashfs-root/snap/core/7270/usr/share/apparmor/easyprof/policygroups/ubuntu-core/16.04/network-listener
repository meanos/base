# java apps request this but seem to work fine without it. Netlink sockets
# are used to talk to kernel subsystems though and since apps run as root,
# allowing blanket access needs to be carefully considered. Kernel capabilities
# checks (which apparmor mediates) *should* be enough to keep abuse down,
# however Linux capabilities can be quite broad and there have been CVEs in
# this area. The issue is complicated because reservied policy groups like
# 'network-admin' and 'network-firewall' have legitimate use for this rule,
# however a network facing server shouldn't typically be running with these
# policy groups. For now, explicitly deny to silence the denial. LP: #1499897
